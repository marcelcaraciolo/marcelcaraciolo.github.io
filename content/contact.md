## Open-Source Software

I am an advocate of Open-Source Software Development (OSS), both for using it and contributing to it. Read more about OSS [here](https://opensource.org/osd). Usually when it is applicable, I try to open-source my projects for any contributions and general use. For an overview of my open source contributions, take a look at my [projects]().

## Tech stack

My familiar tech stack  and technologies that I use in most of my projects are Python, Django, Flask, Jupyter notebooks, docker and pandas.For Agile projects, I am practicioner of Kanban and Scrum.

 Anyway I always looking after new tech tendencies and a wider range of frameworks, languages and libraries.
