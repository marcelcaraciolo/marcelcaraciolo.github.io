# Current and Previous Jobs

- Bioinformatics coordinator and lab management systems manager at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, responsible for manage the genetic laboratory systems and the bioinformatics team for genomics healthcare.

All my previous experience can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelcaraciolo/).

## Open Source Software

All the OOS projects that I contributed, you can find on my [Github](https://github.com/marcelcaraciolo).

The current OSS project that I am working on:

 - [runpandas](https://github.com/corriporai/runpandas): Python Package for handing running data from GPS-enabled tracking devices and applications.

## Books

I love writing, so besides my [tech](https://medium.com/genomics-healthcare-systems) and [running](https://www.corriporai.com.br/) blogs, I started writing a book about running data analytics with Python.
 - [Programming with RunPandas - Full Handbook](https://github.com/corriporai/runpandasbook): A Jupyter based book for running data analysis with runpandas.
